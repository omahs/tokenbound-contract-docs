# Welcome to the Tokenbound Documentation Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Tokenbound Documentation!

This guide aims to provide an overview of the contribution workflow to help us make the contribution process effective for everyone involved.

## Getting started
You can contribute to this repo in many ways:

- Solve open issues
- Improve the documentation
  
Contributions are made via Issues and Pull Requests (PRs). A few general guidelines for contributions:

- Search for existing Issues and PRs before creating your own.
- Contributions should only fix/add the functionality in the issue OR address style issues, not both.
- If you run into an issue or need clarification, please give context. Explain what you're trying to do and how we can help.

### Issues
Issues should be used to report problems, request a new feature, or discuss potential changes before a PR is created.

Solve an issue
Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/horuslabsio/tokenbound-contract-docs/issues) to find one that interests you.


### Pull Requests

#### Pull Request Process

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the project
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name
4. Commit your changes to the new branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository and tag one of the maintainers to review your PR

Here are some tips for a high-quality pull request:

- Create a title for the PR that accurately defines the work done.
- Structure the description neatly to make it easy to consume by the readers. For example, you can include bullet points and screenshots instead of having one large paragraph.
- Add the link to the issue if applicable.
- Have a good commit message that summarises the work done.

Once you submit your PR:

- We may ask questions, request additional information or ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. Please note that these are to make the PR clear for everyone involved and aims to create a frictionless interaction process.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation resolved.

Once the PR is approved, we'll "squash-and-merge" to keep the git commit history clean.
